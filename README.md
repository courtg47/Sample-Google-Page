Sample Google Front Page Project

This project will reconstruct the look of the homepage for Google.com. Once completed, the following skills will have been learned to a greater degree than before: HTML, CSS, Chrome Developer Tools, the command line, git, and github will all be utilized. This page will not function as a search page, but will simply mimic the look of Google.
